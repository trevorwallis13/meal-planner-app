<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pick My Meals Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://pickmymeals.herokuapp.com)

My wife and I have a Sunday night ritual -- she asks, "What do you want for dinners this week?" and I respond, "Um... I don't know. You pick." (It's not a very productive conversation, for sure.)

I built Pick My Meals to solve this problem. Now, we add our dinner options to our list and let it choose our dinners for us -- no more awkward back-and-forth while she's writing a grocery list!

Of course, we always have the option to pick our own meals for the week. Pick My Meals allows you to add, swap, remove, and rearrange meals on your calendar. Or you can pick your meals for a few days and let the app fill in the rest.
